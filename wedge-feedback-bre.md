## Feedback 

It doesn't look like your `submission.md` file is fully filled in. 

This is currently complete at the C level, but I've been under the impression you're going for an A. I'm open to a revision round on this to bring it up to a B if you'd like. And maybe you could use some extra A/B Choice assignments to end slightly higher? Just let me know what you're thinking 


### Task 1

It doesn't appear this really happened. Did you attempt the B-level version? 

### Task 2

* Nice job on this task. 
* I appreciate that you took the time to do this with the reproducible approach. 
* This is pretty much as efficient an approach as is possible. 


### Task 3

* Nice job on this, very efficient. 
* You did a _lot_ of extra work on this one, continuing the analysis with some of the example business questions I gave. That's awesome, but it wasn't required.
